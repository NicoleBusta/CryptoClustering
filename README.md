## Background
In this analysis, Python and Principle Component Analysis for Unsupervised Machine Learning were used to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.


## Results
For details and analysis, refer to the Jupyter Notebook file above.  Also, below are the visuals for easier reference:
